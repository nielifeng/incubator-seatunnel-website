About the Connector Access Incentive Plan<a class="hash-link" href="#1-about-the-connector-access-incentive-plan" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Firstly, let me introduce the SeaTunnel Connector Access Incentive Program, and the steps to develop a connector from start to finish (even for novices). This includes the whole process of preparation for development, testing, and final PR.</p><p>The SeaTunnel community released a new connector API not long ago, which supports running on various engines, including Flink, Spark, and more. This eliminates the need for repeated development of the old version.</p><p>After the new API is released, the old connector needs to be migrated, or the new connector should be supported.</p><p>In order to motivate the community to actively participate in the SeaTunnel Connector Access work and help build SeaTunnel into a more efficient data integration platform, the SeaTunnel community-initiated activities, sponsored by Beluga Open Source.</p><p>The activities have three modes: simple, medium, and hard for the task of accessing the connector. The threshold is low.</p><p>You can see which tasks need to be claimed on the activity issue list, as well as segmentation based on difficulty and priority. You can choose the activity you are comfortable with. You can start contributing based on the difficulty level.
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*laqub6yhNDOqPaGc"></p><p>The ecological construction of SeaTunnel can become more complete and advanced only with the help of your contributions. You are welcome to participate actively.</p><p>In order to express our gratitude, our event has set up a link where points can be exchanged for physical prizes. The more points you get, the more prized you can win!</p><p>Presently, we‚Äôve seen many small partners participate in the event and submit their connectors. It‚Äôs not too late to join as there is still a significant period of time before the event ends. Based on the difficulty of the activity, the deadline may be relaxed or extended.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="2-preparations-before-claimingdeveloping-connectors">2.

A connector is composed of Source and SInk (Source + Sink).</p><p>In the above figure, the connectors are connected to various data sources at the upper and lower layers. The source is responsible for reading data from external data sources, while the sink is responsible for writing data to external sources.</p><p>There is also an abstraction layer between the source and the sink.</p><p>Through this abstraction later, the data types of various data sources can be uniformly converted into the data format of SeaTunnelRow. This allows users to arbitrarily assemble various sources and sinks, so as to realize the integration of heterogeneous data sources, and data synchronization between multiple data sources.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="02-how-to-claim-a-connector">02. How to claim a connector<a class="hash-link" href="#02-how-to-claim-a-connector" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>After understanding the basic concepts, the next step is to claim the connector.</p><p>GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel/issues/1946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel/issues/1946</a></p><p>You can use the above-mentioned GitHub link to see our plans for connecting to the connector. You can make any additions at any time.</p><p>First, find a connector that has not been claimed. To avoid conflicts, search the entire issue to see if anyone has submitted a PR.</p><p>After claiming the connector, we suggest that you create an issue of the corresponding feature, synchronize the problems you encountered in the development, and discuss the design of your solution.</p><p>If you encounter any problems and need help, you can describe them in the issue, and the community can take it up together. Participate in the discussions to help solve the problem. This is also added to the record of the function implementation process, which makes it easy to refer to when maintaining and modifying in the future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="03-compile-the-project">03.

Small Issues/Tasks During Development<a class="hash-link" href="#3-small-issuestasks-during-development" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Next, you have to officially enter the connector development process. What problems may be encountered during the development process?</p><p>The connector is divided into the source and sink ends ‚Äî you can choose either one or both.</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/640/0*QxOnCYLu4AcvKw58"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="01-source-related-development">01. Source-related development<a class="hash-link" href="#01-source-related-development" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The first thing to pay attention to when developing a source is to determine the reading mode of the source: is it streaming or batch? Is support still required?</p><p>Use the Source#getBoundedness interface to mark the modes supported by the source.</p><p>For example, Kafka naturally supports streaming reading, but it can also support batch mode reading by obtaining lastOffset in the source.</p><p>Another question to be aware of: does the source require concurrent reads? If it is single concurrency, after the source is started, a reader will be created to read the data from the data source.</p><p>If you want to achieve multi-concurrency, you need to implement an enumerator interface through which data blocks are allocated to readers, and the readers each read their allocated data blocks.</p><p>For example, the Kafka source uses partition sharding, and the jdbc source uses fields for range query sharding. It should be noted here that if it is a concurrent reading method, the stability of the data block distribution rules must be ensured.</p><p>This is because currently, the connector has a corresponding enumerator on each shard in actual operation, and it is necessary to ensure that the enumerator has data in each shard.</p><p>Thirdly, does the source need to support resumable transfer/state restoration?</p><p>If you want to support this, you need to implement:</p><ul><li><strong>Source#restoreEnumerator</strong>: restore state</li><li><strong>Enumerator#snapshotState</strong>: storage shard allocation</li><li><strong>Reader#snapshotState</strong>: stores the read position</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="02-sink-related-development">02.

Therefore, it is recommended that you import tools/checkstyle/checkStyle.xml from the project during development, and use a unified coding format.</p><p>Whether it is a source or a sink, it will involve defining the data format.

We‚Äôll divide it into four key parts:</p><p>‚óè The definition of a Connector</p><p>‚óè How to access data sources and targets</p><p>‚óè Code to demonstrate how to implement a Connector</p><p>‚óè Sources and targets that are currently supported</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="definition-of-a-connector">Definition of a Connector<a class="hash-link" href="#definition-of-a-connector" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The Connector consists of Source and Sink and is a concrete implementation of accessing data sources.</p><p>Source: The Source is responsible for reading data from sources such as MySQLSource, DorisSource, HDFSSource, TXTSource, and more.</p><p>Sink: The Sink is responsible for writing read data to the target, including MySQLSink, ClickHouseSink, HudiSink, and more. Data transfer, and more specifically, data synchronization is completed through the cooperation between the Source and Sink.</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/298/1*hsfa9Xtzt7o028XjCpqoOg.png"></p><p>Of course, different sources and sinks can cooperate with each other.</p><p>For example, you can use MySQL Source, and Doris Sink to synchronize data from MySQL to Doris, or even read data from MySQL Source and write to HDFS Sink.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="how-to-access-data-sources-and-targets">How to access data sources and targets<a class="hash-link" href="#how-to-access-data-sources-and-targets" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="how-to-access-source">How to access Source<a class="hash-link" href="#how-to-access-source" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Firstly, let‚Äôs take a look at how we can access the Source. To elaborate, let‚Äôs dive in and check out how we can implement a source and the core interfaces that need to be implemented to access the Source.</p><p>The simplest Source is a single concurrent Source. However, if a source does not support state storage and other advanced functions, what interfaces should we implement in these simple single concurrent sources?</p><p>Firstly, we need to use getBoundedness in the Source to identify whether the Source supports real-time or offline, or both.</p><p>createReader creates a Reader whose main function is to read the specific implementation of data. A single concurrent source is really simple as we only need to implement one method, pollNext, through which the read data is sent.</p><p>If concurrent reading is required, what additional interfaces should we implement?
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/393/1*bRxRjyMOGkVqseQkg0ONWg.png"></p><p>For concurrent reading, we‚Äôll introduce a new member, called the Enumerator.</p><p>We implement createEnumerator in Source, and the main function of this member is to create an Enumerator to split the task into segments and then send it to the Reader.</p><p>For example, a task can be divided into 4 splits.</p><p>If it is concurrent twice, it‚Äôll correspond to two Readers. Two of the four splits will be sent to Reader1, and the other two will be sent to Reader2.</p><p>If the number of concurrencies is more ‚Äî for example, let‚Äôs say there are four concurrences, then you have to create four Readers. You have to use the corresponding four splits for concurrent reading for improved efficiency.</p><p>A corresponding interface in the Enumerator called the addSplitsBack sends the splits to the corresponding Reader. Through this method, the ID of the Reader can be specified.</p><p>Similarly, there is an interface called the addSplits in the Reader to receive the splits sent by the Enumerator for data reading.</p><p>In a nutshell, for concurrent reading, we need an Enumerator to implement task splitting and send the splits to the reader. Also, the reader receives the splits and uses them for reading.</p><p>In addition, if we need to support resuming and exactly-once semantics, what additional interfaces should we implement?</p><p>If the goal is to resume the transfer from a breakpoint, we must save the state and restore it. For this, we need to implement a restoreEnumerator in Source.</p><p>The restoreEnumerator method is used to restore an Enumerator through the state and restore the split.</p><p>Correspondingly, we need to implement a snapshotState in this enumerator, which is used to save the state of the current Enumerator and perform failure recovery during checkpoints.</p><p>At the same time, the Reader will also have a snapshotState method to save the split state of the Reader.</p><p>In the event of a failed restart, the Enumerator can be restored through the saved state. After the split is restored, reading can be continued from the place of failure, including fetching and incoming data.</p><p>The exact one-time semantics actually requires the source to support data replays, such as Kafka, Pulsar, and others. In addition, the sink must be submitted in two phases, i.e., the precise one-time semantics can be achieved with the cooperation of these two sources and sinks.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="how-to-access-sink">How to access Sink<a class="hash-link" href="#how-to-access-sink" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Now, let‚Äôs take a look at how to connect to the Sink. What interfaces does the Sink need to implement?</p><p>Truth be told, Sink is relatively simple. For concurrent sinks, when state storage and two-phase commit are not supported, the Sink is simple.</p><p>To elaborate, the Sink does not distinguish between stream synchronization and batch synchronization as the Sink ‚Äî and the entire SeaTunnel API system ‚Äî supports <strong>Unified Stream and Batch Processing.</strong></p><p>Firstly, we need to implement createWriter. A Writer is used for data writing.</p><p>You need to implement a writer method in Writer through which data is written to the target library.</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/414/1*xQ7DRHdBGv-ofjSYdSHAoA.png"></p><p>As shown in the figure above, if two concurrencies are set, the engine will call the createWriter method twice in order to generate two Writers. The engine will feed data to these two writers, which will write the data to the target through the write method.</p><p>For a more advanced setup, for example, we need to support <strong>two-phase commit and state storage</strong>.</p><p>Here, what additional interfaces should we implement?</p><p>First, let‚Äôs introduce a new member, the Committer, whose main role is for the second-stage commit.</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/414/1*cvj1i2A-E-1c_bCZneshtg.png"></p><p>Since Sink is stored in state, it is necessary to restore Writer through the state. Hence, restoreWriter should be implemented.</p><p>Also, since we have introduced a new member, the Committer, we should also implement a createCommitter in the sink. We can then use this method to create a Committer for the second-stage commit or rollback.</p><p>In this case, what additional interfaces does Writer need to implement?</p><p>Since it is a two-phase commit, the first-phase commit is done in the Writer through the implementation of the prepareCommit method ‚Äî which is mainly used for the first-phase commit.</p><p>In addition, state storage and failure recovery is also supported, meaning we need snapshotState to take snapshots at checkpoints. This saves the state for failure recovery scenarios.</p><p>The Committer is the core here. It is mainly used for rollback and commit operations in the second phase.</p><p>For the corresponding process, we need to write data to the database. Here, the engine will trigger the first stage commit during the checkpoint, and then the Writer needs to prepare a commit.</p><p>At the same time, it will return commitInfo to the engine, and the engine will judge whether the first stage commits of all writers are successful.</p><p>If they are indeed successful, the engine will use the commit method to actually commit.</p><p>For MySQL, the first-stage commit just saves a transaction ID and sends it to the commit. The engine determines whether the transaction ID is committed or rolled back.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="how-to-implement-the-connector">How to implement the Connector<a class="hash-link" href="#how-to-implement-the-connector" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We‚Äôve taken a look at Source and Sink; let‚Äôs now look at how to access the data source and implement your own Connector.</p><p>Firstly, we need to build a development environment for the Connector.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-necessary-environment">The necessary environment<a class="hash-link" href="#the-necessary-environment" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><ol><li><p>Java 1.8\11, Maven, IntelliJ IDEA</p></li><li><p>Windows users need to additionally download gitbash (<a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://gitforwindows.org/</a>)</p></li><li><p>Once you have these, you can download the SeaTunnel source code by cloning the git.</p></li><li><p>Download SeaTunnel source code 1, git clone <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel.git2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel.git2</a>, cd incubator-seatunnel</p></li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="seatunnel-engineering-structure">SeaTunnel Engineering Structure<a class="hash-link" href="#seatunnel-engineering-structure" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>We then open it again through the IDE, and see the directory structure as shown in the figure:</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*utRhNAsYiqQqBFa4Tjewgw.png"></p><p>The directory is divided into several parts:</p><ol><li>Connector ‚Äî v2</li></ol><p>Specific implementation of the new Connector(Connector ‚Äî v2) will be placed in this module.</p><ol start="2"><li>connector-v2-dist</li></ol><p>The translation layer of the new connector translates into specific engine implementation ‚Äî instead of implementing under corresponding engines such as Spark, Flink, and ST-Engine.

At the same time, switch the branch to api-draft, and currently use this branch to develop the new version of the API and the corresponding Connector.

means that SeaTunnel can find the jar package corresponding to the project by looking for a Source named FakeSource.

In order to solve these problems, Li Zongwen aimed to decouple Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) from thw computing engines, and re-factor the Source and Sink apis to improve the development experience.</p><p>This speech mainly consists of five parts.The first part is about Apache SeaTunnel (Incubator) refactoring background and motivation. The second part introduces Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) Target for refactoring.The third part discusses Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) overall design for refactoring. The last two parts is about Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) Source API design and Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) Sink API design.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="01-background-and-motivation-for-refactoring">01 Background and motivation for refactoring<a class="hash-link" href="#01-background-and-motivation-for-refactoring" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Those of you who have used Apache SeaTunnel (Incubator) or developers should know that Apache SeaTunnel (Incubator) is now fully coupled with the engine, which is entirely based on Spark or Flink, and so are the configuration file parameters. From the perspective of contributors and users, we can find they face some problems.</p><p>In the view of the contributors, repeated implementing connector is meaningless and it is unable for potential contributors to contribute to the community due to inconsistent engine versions.</p><p>At present, many companies use Lambda architecture, Spark is used for offline operations and Flink is used for real-time operations. In the view of the users, it can be found that Spark may have the Connector of SeaTunnel, but Flink does not, and the parameters of the two engines for the Connector of the same storage engine are not unified, thus resulting a high cost of and deviating from its original intention of being easy to use. And some users question that Flink version 1.14 is not supported nowadays. While with the current SeaTunnel architecture, we must discard the previous version in order to support Flink version 1.14, which will bring great trouble for early version users.</p><p>As a result, it was difficult for us to either upgrade engine or support more versions.</p><p>In addition, Spark and Flink both adopt the Checkpoint fault-tolerant mechanism implemented by Chandy-Lamport algorithm and internally unify DataSet and DataStream. On this premise, we believe decoupling is feasible.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="02-apache-seatunnel-incubating-decouples-with-computing-engine">02 Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) decouples with computing engine<a class="hash-link" href="#02-apache-seatunnel-incubating-decouples-with-computing-engine" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Therefore, in order to solve the problems raised above, we set the following goals.</p><ol><li><p>Connector is only implemented once. To solve the problems that parameters are not unified and Connector is implemented for too many times, we hope to achieve a unified Source and Sink API;</p></li><li><p>Multiple versions of Spark and Flink engines are supported. A translation layer above the Source and Sink API is added to support multiple versions of Spark and Flink engines.</p></li><li><p>The logic for parallel shard of Source and the Sink submission should be clarified. We must provide a good API to support Connector development.</p></li><li><p>The full database synchronization in real-time scenarios should be supported. This is a derivative requirement that many users have mentioned for CDC support. I once participated the Flink CDC community before and many users pointed out that in the CDC scenario, if you wanted to use the Flink CDC directly, each table would have a link and there would be thousands of links for thousands of tables when you need to synchronize the whole library, which was unacceptable for both the database and the DBA. To solve this problem, the simplest way was to introduce Canal„ÄÅDebezium or other components, which were used to pull incremental data to Kafka or other MQ for intermediate storage, and then we could use Flink SQL for synchronization. This actually contradicted the original idea of the Flink CDC to reduce links. However, the Flink CDC aimed only a Connector and was unable to deal with the whole link, so the proposal was not seen in the SeaTunnel community. By the chance of the reconstruction, we submitted the proposal to the SeaTunnel community.</p></li><li><p>Automatic discovery and storage of meta information are realized. The users should have awful experience due to the storage engines such as Kafka lacking of record of the data structure, when we need to read structured data, the user must define the topic of structured data types before read one topic at a time . We hope once the configuration is completed, there is no need to do any redundant work again.</p></li></ol><p>Some people may wonder why we don‚Äôt use Apache Beam directly. That is because Beam sources are divided into BOUNDED and UNBOUNDED sources, which means it needs to be implemented twice. Moreover, some features of Source and Sink are not supported, which will be mentioned later.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="03-apache-seatunnelincubating-overall-design-for-refactoring">03 Apache SeaTunnel(Incubating) overall design for refactoring<a class="hash-link" href="#03-apache-seatunnelincubating-overall-design-for-refactoring" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/1-cbc169e3bc121f1008b807103abe9fd8.jpg" width="1440" height="810"></p><p>The Apache SeaTunnel(Incubating) API architecture is described in the picture above.</p><p>The Source &amp; Sink API is one of the core APIS of data integration, which defines the logic for parallel shard of Source and the commitment of Sink to realize the Connector.</p><p>The Engine API includes the translation and the execution layers. The translation is used to translate Souce and Sink API of SeaTunnel into connectors that can be run inside the engine.</p><p>The execution defines the execution logic of Source, Transform, Sink and other operations in the engine.</p><p>The Table SPI is mainly used to expose the interface of Source and Sink in SPI mode, and to specify mandatory and optional parameters of Connector etc.</p><p>The DataType includes SeaTunnel data structure used to isolate engines and declare Table schema.</p><p>The Catalog is Used to obtain Table schemes and Options, etc. The Catalog Storage is used to store Table Schemes defined by unstructured engines such as Kafka.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2-507471aef3b2e7dc6ee4bc03188bc784.jpg" width="1440" height="810"></p><p>The execution flow we assumed nowadays can be see in the above picture.</p><ol><li><p>Obtain task parameters from configuration files or UI.</p></li><li><p>Obtain the Table Schema, Option and other information by analyzing the parameters from Catalog.</p></li><li><p>Pull up the Connector of SeaTunnel in SPI mode and inject Table information.</p></li><li><p>Translate the Connector from SeaTunnel into the Connector within the engine.</p></li><li><p>Execute the operation logic of the engine. The multi-table distribution in the picture only exists in the synchronization of the whole database of CDC, while other connectors are single tables and do not need the distribution logic.</p></li></ol><p>It can be seen that the hardest part of the plan is to translate Source and Sink into an internal Source and Sink in the engine.</p><p>Many users today use Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) not only as a data integration tool but also as a data storage tool, and use a lot of Spark and Flink SQLs. We want to preserve that SQL capability for users to upgrade seamlessly.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/3-68113e215aa8e91a5d2469ccb37a3c22.jpg" width="1440" height="810"></p><p>According to our research, the feature above shows the ideal execution logic of Source and Sink. Since SeaTunnel is incubated as WaterDrop, the terms in the figure are tended towards Spark.</p><p>Ideally, the Source and Sink coordinators can be run on the Driver, and the Source Reader and Sink Writer will run on the Worker. In terms of the Source Coordinator, we expect it to support several features.</p><p>The first capability is that the slicing logic of data can be dynamically added to the Reader.</p><p>The second is that the coordination of Reader can be supported. Source Reader is used to read data, and then send the data to the engine, and finally to the Source Writer for data writing. Meanwhile, Writer can support the two-phase transaction submission, and the coordinator of Sink supports the aggregation submission requirements of Connector such as Iceberg.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="04-source-api">04 Source API<a class="hash-link" href="#04-source-api" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>After research, we found the following features that are required by Source.</p><ol><li><p>Unified offline and real-time API , which supports that source is implemented only once and supports both offline and real-time API;</p></li><li><p>Supportive of parallel reading. For example that Kafka generates a reader for each partition and execute in parallel.</p></li><li><p>Supporting dynamic slice-adding. For example, Kafka defines a regular topic, when a new topic needs to be added due to the volume of business, the Source API allows to dynamically add the slice to the job.</p></li><li><p>Supporting the work of coordinating reader, which is currently only needed in the CDC Connector. CDC is currently supported by NetFilx‚Äôs DBlog parallel algorithms, which requires reader coordination between full synchronization and incremental synchronization.</p></li><li><p>Supporting a single reader to process multiple tables, i.e. to allows the whole database synchronization in the real-time scenario as mentioned above.</p></li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/4-ac907e3f8e305b9f6585d2171013a973.jpg" width="1440" height="810"></p><p>Based on the above requirements, we have created the basic API as shown in the figure above.

If you‚Äôre interested, you can view the code in detail.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="how-to-adapt-to-spark-and-flink-engines">How to adapt to Spark and Flink engines<a class="hash-link" href="#how-to-adapt-to-spark-and-flink-engines" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Flink and Spark unify the API of DataSet and DataStream, and they can support the first two features. Then, for the remaining three features, how do we</p><ul><li>Support dynamic slice-addingÔºü</li><li>Support the work of coordinating readerÔºü</li><li>Support a single reader to process multiple tablesÔºü</li></ul><p>Let&#x27;s review the design with questions.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/5-f743cf882b36bb3c383c66dec4bad95f.jpg" width="1440" height="810"></p><p>We found that other connectors do not need coordinators, except for CDC. For those connectors that do not need coordinators, we have a Source that supports parallel execution and engine translation.</p><p>As shown in the figure above, there is a slice enumerator on the left, which can list which slices the source needs and show what there are. After enumerating slices in real time, each slice would be distributed to SourceReader, the real data reading module. Boundedness marker is used to differentiate offline and real-time operations. Connector can mark whether there is a stop Offset in a slice. For example, Kafka can support real-time and offline operations. The degree of parallelism can be set for the ParallelSource in the engine to support parallel reading.</p><p>As shown in the figure above, in a scenario where a coordinator is required, Event transmission is done between the Reader and Enumerator. Enumerator coordinates events by the Event sent by the Reader. The Coordinated Source needs to ensure single parallelism at the engine level to ensure data consistency. Of course, this does not make good use of the engine‚Äôs memory management mechanism, but trade-offs are necessary.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/6-ef5d53449db28f4466c14827335d07a6.jpg" width="1440" height="810"></p><p>For the last question, how can we support a single reader to process multiple tables? This involves the Table API layer. Once all the required tables have been read from the Catalog, some of the tables may belong to a single job and can be read by a link, and some may need to be separated, depending on how Source is implemented. Since this is a special requirement, we want to make it easier for the developers. In the Table API layer, we will provide a SupportMultipleTable interface to declare that Source supports multiple Table reads. The Source is implemented based on the corresponding deserializer of multiple tables. As for how to separate derived multi-table data, Flink will adopt Side Output mechanism, while Spark is going to use Filter or Partition mechanism.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="5-sink-api">5 Sink API<a class="hash-link" href="#5-sink-api" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>At present, there are not many features required by Sink, but three mojor requirements are considerable according to our research.</p><p>The first is about idempotent writing, which requires no code and depends on whether the storage engine can support it.</p><p>The second is about distributed transactions. The mainstream method is two-phase commitments, such as Kafka etc.</p><p>The third is about the submission of aggregation. For Storage engines like Iceberg and Hoodie, we hope there is no issues triggered by small files, so we expect to aggregate these files into a single file and commit it as a whole.</p><p>Based on these three requirements, we built three APIS: SinkWriter, SinkCommitter, and SinkAggregated Committer. SinkWriter plays a role of writing, which may or may not be idempotent. SinkCommitter supports for two-phase commitments. SinkAggregatedCommitter supports for aggregated commitments.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/7-e9830d63f81f7139a7cd1d4d9b9f5e43.jpg" width="1440" height="810"></p><p>Ideally, AggregatedCommitter runs in Driver in single or parallel, and Writer and Committer run in Worker with multiple parallels, with each parallel carrying its own pre-commit work and then send Aggregated messages to Aggregated committers.</p><p>Current advanced versions of Spark and Flink all support AggregatedCommitter running on the Driver(Job Manager) and Writer and Committer running on the worker(Task Manager).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/8-aa0537c76d15543b46623445ff00e490.jpg" width="1440" height="810"></p><p>However, for the lower versions of Flink, AggregatedCommitter cannot be supported to run in JM, so we are also carrying translation adaptation. Writer and Committer will act as pre-operators, packaged by Flink‚Äôs ProcessFunction, supports concurrent pre-delivery and write, and implement two-phase commitment based on Flink‚Äôs Checkpoint mechanism. This is also the current 2PC implementation of many of Flink connectors. The ProcessFunction can send messages about pre-commits to downstream Aggregated committers, which can be wrapped around operators such as SinkFunction or ProcessFunction. Of course, We need to ensure that only one single parallel will be started by the AggregatedCommitter in case of the broken of the logic of the aggregated commitment.</p><p>Thank you for watching.

SeaTunnel currently supports data synchronization to ClickHouse.</p><p>At the Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) April Meetup, Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) contributor Fan Jia shared the topic of &quot;ClickHouse bulk load implementation based on SeaTunnel&quot;, explaining in detail the implementation principle and process of ClickHouseFile for efficient processing of large amounts of data.</p><p>Thanks to the test engineer Feng Xiulan for the article arrangement!</p><p>This presentation contains seven parts.</p><ul><li>State of ClickHouse Sink</li><li>Scenarios that ClickHouse Sink isn&#x27;t good at </li><li>Introduction to the ClickHouseFile plugin</li><li>ClickHouseFile core technologies</li><li>Analysis of ClickHouseFile plugin implementation</li><li>Comparison of plug-in capabilities</li><li>Post-optimization directions</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/0-1-56defefcc273a6e21b09dd483bf95914.png" width="1171" height="1171"></p><p>Fan Jia,  Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) contributor, Senior Enginee of WhaleOps.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="01-status-of-clickhouse-sink">01 Status of ClickHouse Sink<a class="hash-link" href="#01-status-of-clickhouse-sink" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>At present, the process of synchronizing data from SeaTunnel to ClickHouse is as follows: as long as the data source is supported by SeaTunnel, the data can be extracted, converted (or not), and written directly to the ClickHouse sink connector, and then written to the ClickHouse server via JDBC. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/1-76284c6612152506e0111e0f0d25d0f5.png" width="1139" height="585"></p><p>However, there are some problems with writing to the ClickHouse server via traditional JDBC.</p><p>Firstly, the tool used now is the driver provided by ClickHouse and implemented via HTTP, however, HTTP is not very efficient to implement in certain scenarios. The second is the huge amount of data, if there is duplicate data or a large amount of data written at once, it needs to generate the corresponding insert statement and send it via HTTP to the ClickHouse server-side by the traditional method, where it is parsed and executed item by item or in batches, which does not allow data compression.</p><p>Finally, there is the problem we often encounter, i.e. too much data may lead to an OOM on the SeaTunnel side or a server-side hang due to too much data being written to the server-side too often.</p><p>So we thought, is there a faster way to send than HTTP? If data pre-processing or data compression could be done on the SeaTunnel side, then the network bandwidth pressure would be reduced and the transmission rate would be increased.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="02-scenarios-that-clickhouse-sink-isnt-good-at">02 Scenarios that ClickHouse Sink isn&#x27;t good at<a class="hash-link" href="#02-scenarios-that-clickhouse-sink-isnt-good-at" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><ol><li>If the HTTP transfer protocol is used, HTTP may not be able to handle it when the volume of data is too large and the batch is sending requests in micro-batches.</li><li>Too many INSERT requests may put too much pressure on the server. The bandwidth can handle a large number of requests, but the server-side is not always able to carry them. The online server not only needs data inserts but more importantly, the query data can be used by other business teams. If the server cluster goes down due to too much-inserted data, it is more than worth the cost.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="03-clickhouse-file-core-technologies">03 ClickHouse File core technologies<a class="hash-link" href="#03-clickhouse-file-core-technologies" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>In response to these scenarios that ClickHouse is not good at, we wondered is there a way to do data compression right on the Spark side, without increasing the resource load on the Server when writing data, and with the ability to write large amounts of data quickly? So we developed the ClickHouseFile plugin to solve the problem.</p><p>The key technology of the ClickHouseFile plugin is ClickHouse -local. ClickHouse-local mode allows users to perform fast processing of local files without having to deploy and configure a ClickHouse Server. C lickHouse-local uses the same core as ClickHouse Server, so it supports most features as well as the same format and table engine.</p><p>These two features mean that users can work directly with local files without having to do the processing on the ClickHouse Server side. Because it is the same format, the data generated by the operations we perform on the remote or SeaTunnel side is seamlessly compatible with the server-side and can be written to using ClickHouse local. ClickHouse local is the core technology for the implementation of ClickHouseFile, which allows for implementing the ClickHouse file connector.</p><p>ClickHouse local core is used in the following ways.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2-2367f70ae655c30a94a2ec65e67a6b26.png" width="1112" height="262"></p><p>First line: pass the data to the test_table table of the ClickHouse-local program via the Linux pipeline.</p><p>Lines two to five: create a result_table for receiving data.</p><p>The sixth line: pass data from test_table to the result_table.</p><p>Line 7: Define the disk path for data processing.</p><p>By calling the Clickhouse-local component, the Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) is used to generate the data files and compress the data. By communicating with the Server, the generated data is sent directly to the different nodes of Clickhouse and the data files are then made available to the nodes for the query.</p><p>Comparison of the original and current implementations.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/3-6204c709b48243f88914bfd492dc67f2.png" width="1272" height="576"></p><p>Originally, the data, including the insert statements was sent by Spark to the server, and the server did the SQL parsing, generated and compressed the table data files, generated the corresponding files, and created the corresponding indexes. If we use ClickHouse local technology, the data file generation, file compression and index creation are done by SeaTunnel, and the final output is a file or folder for the server-side, which is synchronized to the server and the server can queries the data without additional operations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="04-core-technical-points">04 Core technical points<a class="hash-link" href="#04-core-technical-points" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/4-d47e1da865afa7ea4de50b2d6e4b6ac1.png" width="1164" height="435"></p><p>The above process makes data synchronization more efficient, thanks to three optimizations we have made to it.</p><p>Firstly, the data is transferred from the pipeline to the ClickHouseFile by the division, which imposes limitations in terms of length and memory. For this reason, we write the data received by the ClickHouse connector, i.e. the sink side, to a temporary file via MMAP technology, and then the ClickHouse local reads the data from the temporary file to generate our target local file, in order to achieve the effect of incremental data reading and solve the OM problem.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/5-9f00635b1727843f705cd5a28632e2e4.png" width="1206" height="565"></p><p>Secondly, it supports sharding. If only one file or folder is generated in a cluster, the file is distributed to only one node, which will greatly reduce the performance of the query. Therefore, we carry out slicing support. Users can set the key for slicing in the configuration folder, and the algorithm will divide the data into multiple log files and write them to different cluster nodes, significantly improving the read performance.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/6-35b30550d6a18fbea49856083aa85094.png" width="1043" height="558"></p><p>The third key optimization is file transfer. Currently, SeaTunnel supports two file transfer methods, one is SCP, which is characterized by security, versatility, and no additional configuration; the other is RSYNC, which is somewhat fast and efficient and supports breakpoint resume, but requires additional configuration, users can choose between the way suits their needs.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="05-plugin-implementation-analysis">05 Plugin implementation analysis<a class="hash-link" href="#05-plugin-implementation-analysis" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>In summary, the general implementation process of ClickHouseFile is as follows.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/7-1be978da30a55fe0289c683f2ae61aac.png" width="533" height="635"></p><p>1.caching data to the ClickHouse sink side.
2.calling ClickHouse-local to generate the file.

He has many years of experience in big data platform development and management, and has rich research experience in data assets, data lineage mapping, data governance, OLAP, and other fields.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="01-background">01 Background<a class="hash-link" href="#01-background" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/1-198d9a9b685f80a9814d5620d1194355.png" width="1166" height="720"></p><p>At present, Kidswant‚Äôs OLAP platform consists of seven parts: metadata layer, task layer, storage layer, SQL layer, scheduling layer, service layer, and monitoring layer. This sharing focuses on offline tasks in the task layer.</p><p>In fact, Kidswant had a complete internal collection and push system, but due to some historical legacy issues, the company‚Äôs existing platform could not quickly support the OLAP platform getting online, so at that time the company had to abandon its own platform and start developing a new system instead.
There were three options in front of OLAP at the time.</p><p>1, Re-develop the collection and push system.</p><p>2„ÄÅSelf-R&amp;D.</p><p>3, Participate in open source projects.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="02-big-data-processing-mainstream-tools-comparison">02 Big data processing mainstream tools comparison<a class="hash-link" href="#02-big-data-processing-mainstream-tools-comparison" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>These three options have their own pros and cons. Carrying re-research and development based on the collection and push system is convenient for us to take advantage of the experience of previous results and avoid repeatedly stepping into the pit. But the disadvantage is that it requires a large amount of code, time, a longer research period, and with less abstract code and lots of customized functions bound to the business, it‚Äôs difficult to do the re-development.</p><p>If completely self-developed, though the development process is autonomous and controllable, some engines such as Spark can be done to fit our own architecture, while the disadvantage is that we may encounter some unknown problems.</p><p>For the last choice, if we use open-source frameworks, the advantage is that there is more abstract code, and the framework can be guaranteed in terms of performance and stability after verification by other major companies. Therefore Kidswant mainly studied three open-source data synchronization tools, DATAX, Sqoop, and SeaTunnel in the early stages of OLAP data synchronization refactoring.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2-fa4598ecce2b564564a8dfb2f7ccae87.png" width="919" height="720"></p><p>From the diagram we can see that Sqoop‚Äôs main function is data synchronization for RDB, and its implementation is based on MAP/REDUCE. Sqoop has rich parameters and command lines to perform various operations. The advantage of Sqoop is that it fits Hadoop ecology, and already supports most of the conversion from RDB to HIVE arbitrary source, with a complete set of commands and APIs.</p><p>The disadvantages are that Sqoop only supports RDB data synchronization and has some limitations on data files, and there is no concept of data cleansing yet.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/3-53716e33ac191ff35ff66591ba4e1711.png" width="1174" height="720"></p><p>DataX mainly aims at synchronizing data from any source by configurable files + multi-threading, which runs three main processes: Reader, Framework, and Writer, where Framework mainly plays the role of communication and leaving empty space.</p><p>The advantage of DataX is that it uses plug-in development, has its own flow control and data control, and is active in the community, with DataX‚Äôs official website offering data pushes from many different sources. The disadvantage of DataX, however, is that it is memory-based and there may be limitations on the amount of data available.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/4-1897837b0d7e4b52bc086c94b5aa4aea.png" width="1025" height="720"></p><p>Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) also does data synchronization from any source and implements the process in three steps: source, transform and sink based on configuration files, Spark or Flink. </p><p>The advantage is that the current 2.1.0 version has a very large number of plug-ins and source pushes, based on the idea of plug-ins also makes it very easy to extend and embrace Spark and Flink while with a distributed architecture. The only downside to Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) is probably the lack of IP calls at the moment and the need to manage the UI interface by yourself.</p><p>In summary, although Sqoop is distributed, it only supports data synchronization between RDB and HIVE, Hbase and has poor scalability, which is not convenient for re-development. DataX is scalable and stable overall, but because it is a standalone version, it cannot be deployed in a distributed cluster, and there is a strong dependency between data extraction capability and machine performance. SeaTunnel, on the other hand, is similar to DataX and makes up for the flaw of non-distributed DataX. It also supports real-time streaming, and the community is highly active as a new product. We chose SeaTunnel based on a number of factors such as whether it supported distributed or not, and whether it needed to be deployed on a separate machine.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="03-implementation">03 Implementation<a class="hash-link" href="#03-implementation" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>On the Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) website, we can see that the basic process of Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) consists of three parts: source, transform and sink. According to the guidelines on the website, Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) requires a configuration script to start, but after some research, we found that the final execution of Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) is bansed on an application submitted by spark-submit that relies on the config file.</p><p>This initialization, although simple, has the problem of having to rely on the config file, which is generated and then cleared after each run, and although it can be dynamically generated in the scheduling script, it raises two questions: 1) whether frequent disk operations make sense; and 2) whether there is a more efficient way to support Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/5-c2ec6a581e98f15b50a0925325be6acf.png" width="1196" height="720"></p><p>With these considerations in mind, we added a Unified Configuration Template Platform module to the final design solution. Scheduling is done by initiating a commit command, and Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) itself pulls the configuration information from the unified configuration template platform, then loads and initializes the parameters.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/6-5d4653fed2f38a65b3e8c04428e1d53e.png" width="1048" height="720"></p><p>The diagram above shows the business process for Kidswant‚Äôs OLAP, which is divided into three sections. The overall flow of data from Parquet, i.e. Hive, through the Parquet tables to KYLIN and CK source.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/7-2eed2f9ff97c6bfcc712e992568dd102.png" width="1080" height="687"></p><p>This is the page where we construct the model, which is generated mainly through drag and drop, with some transactional operations between each table, and micro-processing for Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) on the right.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/8-8d444012b45ea1a51088db223d29efa6.png" width="1247" height="596"></p><p>So we end up submitting the commands as above, where the first one marked in red is <!-- -->[-conf customconfig/jars]<!-- -->, referring to the fact that the user can then unify the configuration template platform for processing, or specify it separately when modeling. The last one marked in red is <!-- -->[421 $start_time $end_time $taskType]<!-- --> Unicode, which is a unique encoding.</p><p>Below, on the left, are the 38 commands submitted by our final dispatch script. Below, on the right, is a modification made for Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating), and you can see a more specific tool class called WaterdropContext. It can first determine if Unicode exists and then use Unicode_code to get the configuration information for the different templates, avoiding the need to manipulate the config file.</p><p>In the end, the reportMeta is used to report some information after the task is completed, which is also done in Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/9-54db46eb9209112af1884f1ef6454536.png" width="720" height="752"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/10-0472de8100ba32800e40ea9e86f3b35f.png" width="1280" height="585"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/11-910cd332e1ebf6b9d7d3ea9186a5c8fa.png" width="1280" height="512"></p><p>In the finalized config file as above, it is worth noting that in terms of transforms, Kidswant has made some changes. The first is to do desensitization for mobile phones or ID numbers etc. If the user specifies a field, they do it by field, if not they will scan all fields and then desensitize and encrypt them according to pattern matching.</p><p>Second, transform also supports custom processing, as mentioned above when talking about OLAP modeling. With the addition of HideStr, the first ten fields of a string of characters can be retained and all characters at the back encrypted, providing some security in the data.</p><p>Then, on the sink side, we added pre_sql in order to support the idempotency of the task, which is mainly done for tasks such as data deletion, or partition deletion, as the task cannot be run only once during production, and this design needed to account for the data deviation and correctness once operations such as reruns or complement occur.</p><p>On the right side of the diagram, on the Sink side of a Clickhouse, we have added an is_senseless_mode, which forms a read/write senseless mode, where the user does not perceive the whole area when querying and complementing but uses the CK partition conversion, i.e. the command called MOVE PARTITION TO TABLE to operate.</p><p>A special note here is the Sink side of KYLIN. KYLIN is a very special source with its own set of data entry logic and its monitoring page, so the transformation we have done on KYLIN is simply a call to its API operation and a simple API call and constant polling of the state when using KYLIN, so the resources for KYLIN are limited in the Unified Template Configuration platform.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/12-859f200352aab300d0e421ba01e86da6.png" width="1249" height="586"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="04-common-problems-about-the-apache-seatunnel-incubating-transformation">04 Common problems about the Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) transformation<a class="hash-link" href="#04-common-problems-about-the-apache-seatunnel-incubating-transformation" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="01-oom--too-many-parts">01 OOM &amp; Too Many Parts<a class="hash-link" href="#01-oom--too-many-parts" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>The problem usually arises during the Hive to Hive process, even if we go through automatic resource allocation, but there are cases where the data amount suddenly gets bigger, for example after holding several events.

Apache SeaTunnel(Incubating) First Apache Release Refactors Kernel and Supports Flink Overall</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-03-18T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 18, 2022</time> ¬∑ <!-- -->6 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>On December 9, 2021, Apache SeaTunnel(Incubating) entered the Apache Incubator, and after nearly four months of endeavor by the community contributors, we passed the first Apache version control in one go and released it on March 18, 2022. This means that version 2.1.0 is an official release that is safe for corporate and individual users to use, which has been voted on by the Apache SeaTunnel(Incubating) community and the Apache Incubator.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> A¬†<strong>software license</strong>¬†is a legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software. A typical software license grants the¬†licensee, typically an¬†end-user, permission to use one or more copies of the software in ways where such a use would otherwise potentially constitute copyright infringement of the software owner&#x27;s¬†exclusive rights¬†under copyright. Effectively, a software license is a contract between the software developer and the user that guarantees the user will not be sued within the scope of the license. </p><p>Before and after entering the incubator, we spent a lot of time sorting through the external dependencies of the entire project to ensure compliance. It is important to note that the choice of License for open source software does not necessarily mean that the project itself is compliant. While the stringent version control process of ASF ensures compliance and legal distribution of the software license maximumly.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="release-note">Release Note<a class="hash-link" href="#release-note" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>We bring the following <strong>key features</strong>to this release:</p><ol><li>The kernel of the microkernel plug-in architecture is overall optimized, which is mainly in Java. And a lot of improvements are made to command line parameter parsing, plug-in loading, etc. At the same time, the users (or contributors) can choose the language to develop plug-in extensions, which greatly reduces the development threshold of plug-ins.</li><li>Overall support for Flink, while the users are free to choose the underlying engine. This version also brings a large number of Flink plug-ins and welcomes anyone to contribute more.</li><li>Provide local development fast startup environment support (example), allow contributors or users quickly and smoothly start without changing any code to facilitate rapid local development debugging. This is certainly exciting news for contributors or users who need to customize their plugins. In fact, we&#x27;ve had a large number of contributors use this approach to quickly test the plugin in our pre-release testing.</li><li>With Docker container installation provided, users can deploy and install Apache SeaTunnel(Incubating) via Docker extremely fast, and we will iterate around Docker &amp; K8s in the future, any interesting proposal on this is welcomed.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="specific-release-notes">Specific release notesÔºö<a class="hash-link" href="#specific-release-notes" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="features">[Features]<a class="hash-link" href="#features" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>Use JCommander to do command line parameter parsing, making developers focus on the logic itself.</li><li>Flink is upgraded from 1.9 to 1.13.5, keeping compatibility with older versions and preparing for subsequent CDC.</li><li>Support for Doris, Hudi, Phoenix, Druid, and other Connector plugins, and you can find complete plugin support here <a href="/[https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel#plugins-supported-by-seatunnel%5D(https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel#plugins-supported-by-seatunnel)">plugins-supported-by-seatunnel</a>.</li><li>Local development extremely fast starts environment support.

Although the first release took a lot of time (mainly for compliance), we think it was well worth it, and that&#x27;s one of the reasons we chose to enter Apache. We need to give our users peace of mind, and Apache is certainly the best choice, with its almost demanding license control that allows users to avoid compliance issues as much as possible and ensure that the software is circulating reasonably and legally. In addition, its practice of the Apache Way, such as public service mission, pragmatism, community over code, openness and consensus decision-making, and meritocracy, can drive the Apache SeaTunnel(Incubating) community to become more open, transparent, and diverse.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/2-1-0">2.1.0</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/blog/tags/release">Release</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">SeaTunnel</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/faq">FAQ</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Releases<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Issue Tracker<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel/pulls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Pull Requests<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Subscribe Mailing List</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/community/contribution_guide/subscribe">How to Subscribe</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:dev-subscribe@seatunnel.apache.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Subscribe Mail<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@seatunnel.apache.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Mail Archive<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">
